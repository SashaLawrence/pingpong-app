# Ping Pong Pairs Generator
This project is the technical exercise for the coding fellowship with DevelopMe.
I will demonstrating my technical abilities in written code. It is also an opportunity to demonstrate my technical thinking and communication skills.

## The brief

The exercise is to create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament bracket from a list of names collected from the user.

It is up to me how I implement this, with JavaScript, React, or PHP, as a web page, or as an app.

**Optional** advanced features might include:

- ability to record scores for each player, or mark which player won from each pairing, to create the next round of the tournament playoffs
- continued rounds created until the final (last 2 players who have won all matches to date play each other, one marked as the winner)

**Some suggestions**

As employers will be looking at my code, I need demonstrate clear thinking, good quality code and use of comments.

I should document what you have done and why, to demonstrate your thinking.

**How to get my app running**

If my tool requires a particular environment to run (e.g. Node or PHP) then this should be documented with instructions provided (e.g. a Vagrantfile, package.json, gulpfile.js etc.). In short: an employer shouldn't struggle to get it working on their local machine, and you shouldn't assume they know how it is supposed to work.

**GIT - version managing**


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
